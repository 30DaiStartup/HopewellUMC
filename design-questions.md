# Hopewell UMC Website - Design Questions & Decisions Needed
**Purpose**: Questions requiring user input before proceeding with build
**Date**: October 22, 2025

---

## CRITICAL DECISIONS (Need before starting build)

### 1. PHOTOGRAPHY AVAILABILITY

**Question**: What photos do you currently have available?

**Need to know**:
- [ ] Do you have ANY professional photos of church activities, worship, people?
- [ ] Do you have recent photos showing diverse congregants?
- [ ] Do you have interior/exterior building photos?
- [ ] Do you have staff photos (at least Pastor Don)?

**Impact**:
- Brooklake design is photography-driven
- Without photos, we need to use placeholders initially
- Affects timeline for complete site

**Options**:
1. Use existing photos now + placeholder images where needed → launch sooner
2. Schedule professional photoshoot first → launch later but complete
3. Use temporary stock photos (church-themed) → replace later with real photos

**My Recommendation**: Start with option 1 (existing + placeholders), create photo shoot list, add real photos in phases

---

### 2. COLOR PALETTE & BRANDING

**Question**: Should we use Brooklake's neutral palette or incorporate Hopewell's brand colors?

**Brooklake Colors**:
- White background (#FFFFFF)
- Dark charcoal text (#2D2D2D)
- Mid grays for secondary text
- Subtle warm red accent (#D84545)

**Hopewell Considerations**:
- Do you have existing brand colors we should use?
- Does UMC have colors you want to incorporate? (typically red and flame logo)
- Do you have a preference for accent colors?

**Need**:
- [ ] Any existing brand guidelines or color preferences?
- [ ] Logo files in high resolution (PNG, SVG)
- [ ] Are there colors you definitely DON'T want?

**My Recommendation**: Start with Brooklake neutral palette, add one Hopewell-specific accent color (warm color that represents your community)

---

### 3. HERO MESSAGE / TAGLINE

**Question**: What should the 3-line hero message be?

**Current options from content inventory**:

Option A (Based on Mission):
```
Everyone has a place here.
Everyone can grow in faith.
Everyone can make a difference.
```

Option B (Based on Pastor Don's message):
```
A church with a place and ministry for every age.
Growing in relationship with Christ.
Serving the Simpsonville community.
```

Option C (More direct):
```
Welcome to Hopewell.
Grow in the Lord.
Show Him to the World.
```

**Need**:
- [ ] Which option resonates most with you?
- [ ] Do you want to write something completely different?
- [ ] Should we incorporate the mission statement directly?

---

### 4. PHOTOGRAPHY PRIORITIES

**Question**: If we need to schedule a photo shoot, what are the must-haves?

**From Brooklake design, photos needed**:
1. Hero carousel images (6-8 photos showing welcome, diversity, community)
2. Pastor Don (professional headshot + candid teaching/interacting)
3. Worship service (congregation from back, people engaged)
4. Fellowship moments (coffee, conversation, hugs/greetings)
5. Various ministries in action
6. Building exterior and interior

**Priority order** (your input needed):
- [ ] Which of the above are MOST important for launch?
- [ ] Which can wait for Phase 2?
- [ ] Do you have a photographer in mind or need recommendations?
- [ ] What is budget/timeline for photography?

**My Recommendation**:
- Minimum for launch: 4 hero images, 1 Pastor Don photo, 1-2 fellowship photos, building exterior
- Phase 2: Complete all ministry photography

**Options**:
1. **Separate entity**: Just a link to separate Learning Center website

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS
