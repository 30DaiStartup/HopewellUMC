## NOTES & ASSUMPTIONS

**Assumptions Made** (Confirm with user):
1. Hopewell wants modern, welcoming design similar to Brooklake
2. Primary audience is newcomers/visitors, not existing members
3. Mobile users are significant portion of traffic
4. Photography will be gathered over time (OK to launch with some placeholders)
5. Simple is better than complex for ongoing maintenance
6. Capital campaign is current priority to highlight
7. Learning Center is significant ministry to feature prominently

**Flexibility**:
- This plan can be adjusted based on answers to design-questions.md
- Phases can be reordered based on priorities
- Features can be added or removed based on resources and timeline
- Platform choice will affect some implementation details but not overall structure

---

**NEXT STEP**: Review design-questions.md and provide answers to finalize plan and begin build.
